== Caveats

*****************************************************************************
  IMPORTANT: This application is *specifically* used to run arbitrary,
  browser-entered code through Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. If you host this application
  and allow public access, you are doing so AT YOUR OWN RISK. And you're also
  certifiably insane.
  
  ONLY, *I REPEAT* ONLY, RUN THIS APPLICATION LOCALLY.  THIS IS A PERSONAL,
  LEARNING/EXPLORATORY TOOL.
  
*****************************************************************************

== Dependencies

1. The `open4' gem (sudo gem install open4)
2. Rails 2+

== Installation

1. Get a copy of the source.
2. Modify `config/database.yml' to your liking.
3. Create databases if necessary, and run `rake db:migrate'
3. Run `ruby script/server'
4. Go forth and hack.

== Limitations

1. No timeouts enforced. If you write a never-ending loop, you'll get one. Feel
   free to contribute fixes.
2. No output limits enforced. The application will try to grab and store
   any output, so be careful here. Feel free to contribute fixes.
3. Benchmarks are not "scientific" by any means.  Take time comparisons
   with a seriously large chunk of salt.  Feel free to contribute fixes.

This application isn't smart, and could use some additional work, as noted above.
Drop me a note if you'd like to contribute any changes.
